### Checkpoint projects

At each roadmap checkpoint, there are checkpoint practice projects. These aren't officially tracked as projects by roadmap, but you can find my [solutions](https://github.com/cescosgames/roadmap_projects/tree/main/checkpoint_recs) to the checkpoint projects
found in the 'Full Stack Developer' roadmap in the folder titled checkpoint_recs.

#### Small Note

After reading the 'Collaborative Work Checkpoint' in the full stack roadmap, the author recommends to save repository names using hyphens rather than underscores and adding licenses to each repository. Since these are practice projects. Moving forward I will implement these changes but not all projects may be up to date in regard to these notes.
