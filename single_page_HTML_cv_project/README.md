# roadmap Changelog Component
In this project, we were required to create a single page CV using only HTML. Key requirements were: Semantic HTML, SEO Meta Tags, OG Tags, Favicon

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML

Since this was just HTML this was mainly looking at the image and writing out the content and assigning the correct semantic categories.

## Lessons Learned:

Fun project styling things without CSS. Learned about accessibility and the use/importance of semantic tags as well as how to use 
OG tags and SEO meta tags more effectively.
