                    We are required to create an accordion component that displays a list of questions or headings. When a user clicks on one of the tabs, it's corresponding answer should
                    appear and close any previously open sections.

                    The design of this project features a main 'wrap' div that encapsulates everything inside of it. Inside this wrap, we have a header section that includes the title and subtext.
                    Each 'tab' is a div that contains the tab header and the tab content. By default, the tab content is set to display none.
                </div>

                </div>
                <div class="accordionContent">
                    We add interactivty to this project by toggling classes on our accordion tabs. In our css, we have an active class that adds displa=block to our tab content and rotates our
                    down caret 180 degrees. We connect our function to toggle this class in our JS by calling foreach on each tab.
