# Accordion Element
This project asked us to create a basic accordion element that displays a list of questions or headings. When a user clicks on a question, its corresponding
answer or content section should expand, while collapsing any previously opened section.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

This project was made using HTML, CSS, and JS, based off of the mockup provided. No external libraries or packages are required.

## Visual Example

## How To Run The Project

To run this project, all you need to do is download or copy the html, css and js files into an empty folder on your computer and launch on your preferred browser. 

## Lessons Learned:

With this project, I tried to expand on my previous approach of commenting out every step and actually tried to explain the project in the accordion itself. This
was good practice in trying to clearly convey ideas and approaches on a small project. 
<br>
With this project, I did end up working inefficiently however after getting hung up on trying to have the accordion content 'roll-down'. This led me down a bit of
a rabbit hole learning about display and how display works. I learned that display none doesn't necessarily interact how you would expect it too sometimes. 
<br>
Lastly, another part I got hung up on was learning about how querySelectorAll doesn't return an array, rather a nodelist. Important to keep in mind in the future.
Overall though, a very satisfying project and I hope my notes clearly convey how it was recreated.
