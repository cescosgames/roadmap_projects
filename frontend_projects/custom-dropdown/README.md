# Custom Dropdown
This project tasked us with creating a custom dropdwon using javascript, based off of a provided mockup. The dropdown required a default state, an open state 
revealing all the options, and a selected state showing the chosen item. Upon selecting the item from the dropdown, the dropdown should close and highlight
the selected item.


## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

The process was similar to the other projects. Design first, then add functionality.

## How To Run The Project

To run this project, copy or download the HTML, CSS, and JS files into your own folder, then open in your preferred browser. No external packages required.

## Lessons Learned:

This project felt fairly straightforward, the requirements were clear and the desired outcome was clear. I did want to add another element to this project that
I will most likely have to revisit in the future. I wanted to add a way to have 'outside' clicks close the dropdown menu if it was open. This was new to me, and
I'm not certain the way I decided to handle it was the best but through this, I learned that you can add click elements to the entire document. It doesn't feel
correct, but for the scope of this project it worked the way I intended it too.
