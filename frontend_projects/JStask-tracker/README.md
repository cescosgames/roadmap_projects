# JS organized task tracker
This project tasked us with creating a task tracker component that allowed users to add new tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them. Completed tasks should move
to the end of the list and give visual feedback about completion. Users should also be able to unmark tasks to have them return to the main list. The goal is to
help practice array manipulation, event handling, and dynamic DOM updates.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

A simple HTML,CSS,JS only project. Design from the mockup -> add functionality.

## Visual Example

## How To Run The Project

To run this project, copy or download the HTML, CSS, and JS files into your own folder, then run in your preferred browser!

## Lessons Learned:

This project asked us to specifically use a renderTasks function that would render the tasks in the correct order. This approach was actually really helpful to 
learning new concepts. I had built a task tracker before, but not one thar organized and loaded tasks by an array. This new approach of loading from an array
felt way better then what I had been doing before and allowed for more control over the tasks since they were all being held inside a single array.
