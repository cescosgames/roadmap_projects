# Title

This project asked us to design a random github repository finder that allows users to select a language from a dropdown menu and recieve some information 
random on randomly selected repository written in that language.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

This project was made using basic HTML, CSS, and JS. No external libraries or packages were used. The github repository search API was used for fetching
the repositories and the languages were fetched from kamranahmedse's language.json file.

## Visual Example

## How To Run The Project

To run this project all you have to do is download/clone/copy the files on to your system in their own folder and open the html in your preferred browser.

## Lessons Learned:

More good practice using the fetch api. The goal of this project was to help us practice api integration, managing async data, and having responsive UI 
states to give feedback to the user. Overall, I'm happy with how this project worked out. Definiteley room for improvement as I made the project messier than
I intended to with the dropdown and didn't have specific error states. If I were to improve on this project, I would definitely add specific error messages 
and links to the repository that was fetched.
