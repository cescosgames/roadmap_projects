# roadmap Changelog Component
In this project, we were required to create a simple component for a website that displays a changelog.
The goal was to enhance positiong and layout skills in just html/css

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Same approach as usual with these projects, get all content necessary for the project in simple HTML then style it using CSS.
This was the first time I was lining items up off center and seeing all the different approaches to the 'timeline line' was fun.

## Lessons Learned:

Lots of different ways to reach the same result in CSS and learned about creative ways to create visuals to convey information like the 
timeline itself
