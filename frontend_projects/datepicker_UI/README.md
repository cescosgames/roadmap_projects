# Datepicker UI only
This project asked us to create a design only (no functionality) datepicker UI using only HTML and CSS. The goal was help practice positioning, layout and styling techniques.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS only

This project required us to use only HTML and CSS to create a mockup for a datepicker UI based on the reference provided. I made this project by targeting each individual section
and filling out the necessary information building from top to bottom. Since we didn't have any reference for how the datepicker UI should react to user input, I applied very
minimal visual feedback.

## How To Run The Project

I just noticed today that the roadmap project ask for this section! Apologies for not having added it until now. This project requires no outside images, packages, or components
whatsoever. To run this project, all you need to do is download the index.html and styles.css file (or copy them into your own version of those files) inside the same empty
folder and open the index.html file in your browser. 

## Lessons Learned:

Not many new concepts here, however using only HTML and CSS I did dive deeper into input fields and visual feedback regarding input fields with just CSS. There is a lot more
flexibliity than I previously imagined in input fields using just css. For example, I was able to create a specific pattern input that would change colors to tell the user whether or not
their input was in the correct format.

There is lots of improvement possible with this project, such as adding functionality but outside of adding functionality I believe all improvements would be based on accessibility.
I'm not sure my decisions were great for accessibility, specifically the colors used and the minimal visual feedback. If we revisit this project, I plan on adding functionality as well
as improved visual feedback.
