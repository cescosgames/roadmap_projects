# Testimnonial Cards Component
In this project, we were required to create some testimonial cards, like the ones often seen on websites. The goal was to teach us about positioning and layout in CSS.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Similar approach to the other frontend projects - gather all necessary componenents in html and stlye in css.

## Lessons Learned:

I'll be honest, I did not approach this project from a clean, reusable code standpoint. In fact I would not recommend using this as a reference outside of the 
individual testimonial cards themselves. Other than that, this was pretty standard practice for positioning and layout. I did learn one super neat trick however.
I wasn't sure how to approach the 'speech bubble' layout with the triangle pointing to the speaker. After some looking online, I learned that in CSS, every border 
connects at an angle and we can use these angles to our advantage by having a 0x0 px box with invisible borders. An invisible left border, and an invisible right border,
with a visible bottom border on a 0x0 px box creates a triangle! Super cool trick
