# Restricted Textarea
This project asked us to create a basic textarea that tracks and displays the number of characters typed by the user along with a maximum character
limit. The character counter should dynamically update and upon reaching the limit, prevent further input and display red text/border to indicate 
the limit being reached.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

This project was made with just HML, CSS, and JS, no external libraries or packages were used. This project was made in a similar fashion to the other
projects; add relevant information in the html, style it in css, give it functionality in js. 

## Visual Example

## How To Run The Project

To run this project, all you need to do is download or copy the html, css, and js into an empty folder on your computer and launch on your preferred browser.
This has only been tested on firefox so I guarantee 100% it will be styled or work as intended on other browsers, even though it should as no features used
are firefox specific.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a relatively straightforward project as outlined by the requirements. I did however want to add more that I was unable to finish within the allotted time. For example,
I ended up using maxLength in the html of the textarea to limit characters to 250 instead of my original plan of handling that in the javascript. If you look at the javascript,
you'll see the different ideas I had that I did not have time to implement. If I am able to revisit this project in the future, I would certainly finish those ideas and revisit
the accessibility of this text area, as to match it to the mockup I had to remove accessibility features such as 'focus' on the text area.

With this project, since it was relateively straightforward, I thought I would try to reasonably comment all my main decisions and why I was making them. 
I hope I was able to clearly convey the flow of this project throught the comments. This is something I plan on continuing to improve in the future as well.
