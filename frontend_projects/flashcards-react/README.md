# A simple flashcard app in React
The goal of this project was to practice and implement state management and componenet based architecture using JavaScript frameworks. We were required to have; pre-defined flashcards with questions
and answers, progress bar to show the user's progress, ability to view flashcards one at a atime and flip to reveal the answer, simple naviation to cycle through the flashcards. The visual mockup
was provided by roadmap.sh.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS, React, Vite, tailwindCSS, npm.

This project was built using React with Vite. Styling was done using tailwindCSS.

## How to Run The Project
1. download or clone the project onto your local environment
<br>git clone
2. Navigate into the project folder
<br>cd repo-name
3. Install all necessary dependencies
<br>npm install
4. npm run dev to preview the build in your local browser! *note* I have not built / previewed / deployed this project before so I can't confirm it will run as intended when built if one decides to build the project.

## Lessons Learned:

Very satisfying project for starting React and js frameworks. Being able to split up the different componenets gave me lots of flexibility in testing and keeping the project organized. Code organization
felt like an enormous benefit on this project. I noted this in my last React projet, but again, I feel the enormous benefit of tailwind in projects like this where having another file open (like css) would
clutter up the screen. useState() allowed for very simple state switching with our questions and answers and passing our questions and answers as props made the whole development process feel swift. 
Overall, I am happy with how this project went and accomplishing all the required tasks.
