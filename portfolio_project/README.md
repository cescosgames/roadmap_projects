# portfolio project
In this project, we were required to create a basic portfolio page based on the HTML only project using only HTML and CSS. This portfolio was made to focus on responsive layouts, color, and typography
to make a visually coherent and clear design. The final project should include a fully responsive website with the same structure as the previous site, consistent use of color
scheme and typography, proper use of CSS, and a responsive nav bar.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Since this was building off the last html only project, this was mostly recreating the last project to allow for css styling. I changed a fair amount of the original project
to create what I envisoned efficiently. 

## Lessons Learned:

My main takeaways from this project were; color consistency and content clarity are very important, dark mode with CSS only is possible and really neat, and finally
mobile first design is the best way to approach modern sites. In this project, I actually didn't use a mobile first approach and after this I plan on changing that entirely.
My future projecs will definitely be designed with mobile first in mind. Also keeping track of colors using variables in CSS allows for really simple dark/light mode switches,
something else I will take with me to all future projects.

Fun quick project but definitely easy to get lost in colors and design. I didn't implement all the pages that I had in the HTML only project since I felt like I wasn't
necessarily learning anything new, just more styling which I could spend far too much time on! Lots of room for improvement if we introduced JS such as having a carousel
for the quotes at the bottom of the page and a dark/light mode switch instead of going off user preferences.
