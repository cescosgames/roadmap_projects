# basic HTML only site project
In this project, we were required to create an HTML only site that featured 4 pages (Homepage, Projects, Articles, Contact). The site
needed to feature a nav bar that could link us to all relevant pages, semantically correct HTML structure, SEO meta tags, and a contact 
form page. 

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML

Just HTML

## Lessons Learned:

Fun short project, never really get to practice using just HTML so this was a fun small project. Styling in HTML only is its own challenge and
while you can't achieve exact visuals, you can get the idea down and that's fun. The contact form could definitely be improved as right now it
doesn't submit or store any information, it is purely visual.
