# Simple webpage showing current time of user
This project asked us to create a simple webpage that would display the time of the user, using the dayjs library and the mockup provided.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS, dayjs, browserify

This was my first real 'package' project outside of tutorials so my approach was different than usual. For this project, I started by installing all the necessary
packages and ensuring I had them working properly before styling any of the site itself. Once I had the packages hooked up and working properly, I styled the site.

## Lessons Learned:

Since this was my first real project using packages, I read a fair amount of documentation and confirmed the importance of thoroughly reading documentation. For example,
I didn't realize until the end that I was using dayjs incorrectly to display information, once I read the documentation regarding displaying information in different
formats, I solved what I was looking to do in a much quicker way with less code.

Most of the other lessons I learned were technical, such as bundling packages so you can 'require' them in your js scripts and how to properly set up packages. I realize
now that the project actually stated we didn't need to use bundles as I did originally, but I'm happy I used both methods in the end.
