# CLI url+css element finder (backend)

Quick project from the node js checkpoint where we needed to create an application that takes a URL and a CSS selector to return the text 
content of the elements that match said selectors.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** 
- CommanderJS for setting up arguments and Cheerio for parsing web pages

## How To Run The Project

1. Download the files onto your local environment, and navigate into the folder you downloaded them into
2. Open in your preferred IDE 
3. In your integrated terminal, call node index.js (or if using nodemon, npx nodemon index.js)
```
node index.js -u 'your.url' -c 'your-css'
```

## Review
Fun little practice project, hadn't used Cheerio before, great documentation super quick to set up. Could definitely be improved, but currently
does exactly what the checkpoint requested. Nothing fancy, just functional
