# nodeJS command line quiz
One of the nodeJS checkpoints is being able to build CLI applications using nodeJS. This command line quiz is the second command line application I built, based on the
fireship tutorial for a command line quiz. This command line application is incredibly simple and does not use any notable functions such as using file system, parsing 
arguments, making http requests, etc.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** node.js, npm

This was done almost entirely inside the terminal inside vscode with testing occuring in the computers main terminal.

## How To Run The Project

Initially, I had this project uploaded to npm but I misunderstood the rules and deleted the first version to upload a fixed version and
discovered you can't publish the same package in the same 24 hour period after deleting it! So apologies, but theoretically, you could run
this package by running npx _name of package_

## Lessons Learned:

In my last two node js projects, I was learning lots of concepts, in this project, we were learning implementation. Although we didn't 
implement any significant or important functions, actually creating a functioning start to finish CLI was very insightful and taught me
the steps I would need to take to go from start to finish. As I move on to more practical command line applications, having this insight 
of start to finish will be invaluable.
