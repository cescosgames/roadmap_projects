# NOTE
For continuity, I wanted to track all my projects within this single mega repo. To make my life easier however with git, I found it quicker to push
larger projects (such as React projects) to github using project specific repos. So in this folder, you won't find anything except for the original
README included in the project repo. 
<br> 
Currently (2/7/25), I have the individual project repos set to private so as to not create clutter. However, I have not figured out how to share private
links so I'll continue to try and figure out how best to present these projects.

# A simple frontend job listing site built using React
This project was created alongside the traversy media 'React Crash Couse 2024' video, which was invaluable to my learning of React. I highly recommend for anyone looking to learn React.
In this project, we learned about a variety of topics from; components, props, state, data fetching, and more to create a dynamic front end site using json server as a mock backend.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS, React, Vite, tailwindCSS, npm, json-server, and toastify

This was my first 'full' project in React, and the process was new to me. The workflow for this specific project was 1. design the site visually first 2. Set up the project using Vite 3. 'Import'
your designed site into the react project and convert any non-functioning html code to JSX 4. break it up into components 5. create a layout and pages 6. add functionality. This is a very
brief way of describing the process but covers the general approach. In another React project I started, I started directly in jsx and added functionality as it was needed. There seem to be
different approaches to React projects and as I continue to create React sites, I will explore as many different methods as possible.

## How to Run The Project
1. download or clone the project onto your local environment
git clone
2. Navigate into the project folder
cd repo-name
3. Install all necessary dependencies
npm install
At this point, you can run the dev build, or, if you have built the project using npm run build, you can run the preview build.
*note!* we are using json server to simulate fetching our job data from a server. If you do not run the server (npm run server) before running the project, you will not see any job listings.

## Lessons Learned:

This was a big one! This week, I decided to dive all in on React. Using this tutorial, other resources, and my own practice project from scratch, I was able to pick up a lot of new information. 
React is fun and incredibly powerful and I believe that throughout this week I have started to understand it's importance in web development. While React will probably be overkill for most of 
the personal projects I need to work on (just landing pages for now), I still plan on working on bigger ideas that would benefit from React. 
<br>
Funny enough, this project also made me realize the ease of tailwind. Working on multiple components at once, not having a css file to remember class names and add class names really speeds up
the workflow. Shoutout tailwind. 
<br>
Overall though, I learned an incredible amount of new concepts and appreciate the power of React. I am excited to continue learning and finish more projects in this framework.
