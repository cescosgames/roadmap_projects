# Tailwind Checkpoint
This wasn't exactly a checkpoint, but I figured I would make one here for myself. At this checkpoint, I wanted to feel comfortable with tailwind. Not
necessarily completely memorize the css->tailwind translations (even though a lot are very intuitevely named), just know 1. how to set it up 2. how to
build with it 3. how to deploy with it. 

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS, npm, tailwind

Sort of confusing writing a how it was made since this wasn't really a goal oriented project, more of a learning project, but my demo example you see in this
project was made with the above tech. To create this, I followed a tutorial on tailwind that aimed to use many different classes and explore the most essential
elements of tailwind.

## Visual Example

In the below visual examples, you will see outlines around each section. I left these outlines in because for me personally it helped me understand tailwind
better.

## How To Run The Project

To run this project, you'll need to download or copy the html, css and js into your own folder. Then you should init your npm, and add tailwindcss through
the command line. There are many other ways to install tailwind, but I prefer the command line. I will say I haven't learned about vite yet, but it seems 
that vite is the preferred way to handle packages like this. Once you've installed tailwind css, make sure to follow the installation docs and import your
css and set it to 'watch.' You can add your own function to start 'watching' inside your package.json file as demonstrated in the package.json file in this folder.

## Lessons Learned:

I spent more time on this than I think I needed too. The most important lesson I believe I learned was this; tailwind css is just css. If you know css, you
know tailwind. It's just putting your css into your html file and renaming things in a more intuitive manner. 
<br>
Once this clicked, tailwind became a lot easier and the challenge was just finding things to design! At first I was hesistant to use tailwind since it just
seemed like css that made my html unreadable, but as I continued to use it, I could feel the 'quickness' of it and having universal naming conventions (as 
opposed to self-named classes) I imagine would make collaborative work much easier. 
<br>
Overall, I really like tailwind. I didn't think I would initially, but I'm glad to have a basic understanding of it. I will probably continue to use plain CSS for some projects and tailwind for others as my projects are small in scope right now. I will say however that tailwind really makes the html feel
'messy' quick. 
<br>
Lots of room for improvement here, and I definitely plan on improving my tailwind capabilities. This mostly seems like a practice that just needs to be repeated many times to speed up efficiency and begin memorizing the common CSS usages.
