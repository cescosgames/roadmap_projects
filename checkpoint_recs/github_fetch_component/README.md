# roadmap Fetch Component
At this checkpoint, we were asked to create a simple webpage where a user can input anyone's GitHub username and see their profile information using GitHubs API.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

Slight different approach to this than past projects. Since Fetch was relatively new to me I decided to build this project alongside
learning about 'fetching' information. The process was; create the html necessary elements (input box, buttons, output box) and style them. 
Once styled, implement the various functionalities I learned about until ultimately making my own GitHub information fetcher.

## Lessons Learned:

This practice led to me learning quite a bit of new information. I tried a different approach than usual with building while learning new 
concepts all in the same project. The final project features all the information I learned through my annotations detailing the progress from 0 fetch 
knowledge to using fetch succesfully. This approach was a fun one and while I would avoid it in future projects, for components it feels like a 
good resource to have. I even got to bring in knowledge I picked up in game dev for parsing through JSON files. As seems to be common with 
these projects lately, I always see room for improvement when I push the files to GitHub for the first time. If I go back to this component,
I would implement what I mention in the JS script regarding catching errors.
