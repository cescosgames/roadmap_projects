# image grid Component
In this project, we were required to create a grid layout using only HTML and CSS. We needed to arrange 6 images in a grid pattern based on a mockup provided
by roadmap.The goal was to get some grid practice and get more comfortable with making grid layouts. We were also required to make the design responsive for mobile, 
although no mockup was provided for what that might look like.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Nothing fancy here, just downloaded some images, put them into an image grid div, and proceeded to style them.

## Lessons Learned:

Another example of different ways to the same results. I experimented with 2 different approaches and left both in the final document so I could
easily switch between the 2 if I wanted too (end result was identical). Making the responsive design was fun and allowed room for creativity which I ended up applying
to the whole project.
