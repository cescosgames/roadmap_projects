# cookies consent Component
In this project, we were required to create a simple cookie consent popup form that would save user preference and load/not load on next visit depending on the users choice.

## How it was made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JS

I approached this project by laying out the HTML, styling the main page with CSS, styling the cookie popup, then programming the JS

## Lessons Learned:

This was a fun project for implementing different functions. I took a different approach this time assigning button functions in HTML and
creating the different necessary functions in JS. To start, I listed out all the functions I would need; accept cookies, close cookies popup, 
save consent preferences, clear consent preferences, unfade page (to undo the fade when the popup is active), and show cookies. Similar to the tabs project, showing or removing the 
cookies popup mostly consisted of adding/removing an active tag from the popup itself.

This project was my first time using localStorage so I learned a good amount about it and it's a very powerful tool. Would love to learn more
about it.

Also in this project, you'll notice that I have a clear consent preferences function called once the website is loaded. This was for testing purposes
since after the first time I accepted, I wouldn't get the popup anymore!
